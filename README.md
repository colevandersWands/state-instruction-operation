learning objectives
* computation can be thought of as a series of operations incrementally modifying state
* a computation is a 'single threaded' path or string of operations & states
* the same code can lead to different paths or strings, depending on what is in state
* the JS engine implements these principles, learn to refactor code to make this explicit
* JS programs are a series of statements, some modify state and others redirect the path (control flow)
* learn also to mark this explicitly with your refactoring


exercise:
* given snippets, refactor them to demonstrate each line's effect on state or program execution
* works really well with pythontutor
